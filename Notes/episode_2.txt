# Episode 2 

- Package.json is the configuration for "NPM"

# adding packages and dependencies into our application

- npm init ( initialising npm , it gives package.json file to us )
- npm install -D parcel ( installing parcel[bundler] into our app through npm)
- transitive dependencies (eg: we need parcel as a dependency in our project, but parcel also have its own dependecies and      these dependencies can have their own dependencies , this is called transitive dependency )
- In project we dont have only only one package.json and package-lock.json , each dependency (eg:parcel) have its own package.  json and package-lock.json as it has its own dependencies.
- node modules should not be added to git , because it can be regenerated through (npm install)
- package.json and package-lock.json should be added to git because they are important files containing the dependency and its exact version in package-lock.json.
- node_modules: The actual code of all dependencies your project needs to run.
- package-lock.json: A detailed map of exactly what should be in node_modules, ensuring consistent installs across different environments.
- import React from "react" ,"react-dom" ( we are importing these from the node-module).
- dist folder , .parce-cache can be re-generated during the build process. so, we can put these into .gitignore file.
